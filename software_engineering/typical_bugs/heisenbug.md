# Heisenbug

In computer programming jargon, a heisenbug is a software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior when 
one attempts to study it.[1] The term is a pun on the name of Werner Heisenberg, the physicist who first asserted 
the observer effect of quantum mechanics, which states that the act of observing a system inevitably alters its 
state. In electronics, the traditional term is probe effect, where attaching a test probe to a device changes 
its behavior.
