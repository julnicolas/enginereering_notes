# Popt
Popt is a well known library to parse argv options.

Here is an excerpt of its github repository.

## README
This is the popt(3) command line option parsing library. While it is similar
to getopt(3), it contains a number of enhancements, including:

	1) popt is fully reentrant
	2) popt can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays while 
	   getopt(3) makes this quite difficult
	3) popt allows users to alias command line arguments
	4) popt provides convenience functions for parsing strings
	   into argv[] style arrays
