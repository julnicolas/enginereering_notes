# User Ranges Defacto Standard
## 0-99
The user ID ranging from `0` to `99` are reserved 
for system accounts, and they are statically assigned. 

## 100-999
Then, the user ID from `100` to `999` is dynamically assigned
for application users.

## 1000-...
Finally, we've seen that for regular user 
accounts, the user ID, by convention, starts from `1000`
