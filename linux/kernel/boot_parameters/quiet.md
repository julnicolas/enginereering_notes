# Quiet

This option tells the kernel to NOT produce any output (a.k.a. Non verbose mode). If you boot without this option,
you'll see lots of kernel messages such as drivers/modules activations, filesystem checks and errors. Not having
the quiet parameter may be useful when you need to find an error.
