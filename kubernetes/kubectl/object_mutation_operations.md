# Objects Mutation Operations
Objects in a kubernetes cluster can be mutated by one of the
following operations:
- `create` - creates the object (aka resource) in the cluster
- `patch` - modifies an existing cluster object
- `delete` - deletes an existing cluster object

These operations can be applied using one off commands as well as
using imperative or declarative object configuration. Please read
associated notes.
