# Advised linters alongside pylint
Source: pylint repo

Projects that you might want to use alongside pylint include `ruff` (really fast, with builtin auto-fix, and 
a growing number of checks taken from popular linters but implemented in rust) or `flake8` (faster and simpler
checks with very few false positives), `mypy`, `pyright` or `pyre` (typing checks), `bandit` (security oriented checks),
`black` and `isort` (auto-formatting), `autoflake` (automated removal of unused imports or variables),
`pyupgrade` (automated upgrade to newer python syntax) and `pydocstringformatter` (automated pep257).
