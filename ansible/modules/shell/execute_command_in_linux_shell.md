# Execute command in linux shell
Use builtin `command` for a system-agnostic module.

``` yaml
- name: Execute the command in remote shell; stdout goes to the specified file on the remote
  ansible.builtin.shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt

- name: Change the working directory to somedir/ before executing the command
  ansible.builtin.shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt
  args:
    chdir: somedir/
```
